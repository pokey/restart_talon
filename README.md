# Talon user file swapper

Contains [Talon](https://talonvoice.com/) commands for swapping user file sets.

## Dependencies

The commands to swap user directories currently only work when VSCode is in front, and rely on adding [a few VSCode user tasks](https://github.com/pokey/dotfiles/blob/782624a0a6e84b38ada0c3b3ee42cab5e252dc3d/vscode/tasks.json#L42-L61). The scripts referenced there can be found in https://github.com/pokey/dotfiles/tree/develop/bin.
